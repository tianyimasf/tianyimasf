👋 Hey! I’m Alex, a recent math graduate with a cs minor and a programmer.

🚀 Current focus 1: ML Thoery (online convex optimization, algorithmic game theory, general ML research paper bi-weekly reading)

🚀 Current focus 2: [Story of Hands](https://github.com/tianyimasf/story-of-hands), an online art game, an intuitive interface for players to guess the story behind a curated collection of hand gesture pictures.

📚 Interests: ML, HCI, data viz, full stack dev

🤔 I’m currently applying for Fall 2023 entry for Georgia Tech's online MSCS program, looking to specialize in Human Computer Interaction(HCI) and work in the interactive media/graphic programming industry.

Stuff I've done:

🌈 [Moving olor gradients](tianyimasf.github.io/color-gradients/): an automatic, color changing canvas using semi-random Bezier curves and bilinear interpolation

📈 Data visualizations: [3D stars in the universe](https://stargazingnight.herokuapp.com/), [Social Network, Temperature Time Series, GIS, Harry Styles Lyrics Data](https://tianyimasf.github.io/pages/work/7.html), [Art History Textbook Data](https://tianyimasf.github.io/pages/work/8.html)

🧠 ML & Kaggle & Datathon: [Fungi Image Classification: from 9 species to 280 different species](https://tianyimasf.github.io/), [9-species page](https://tianyimasf.github.io/pages/work/0.html), [hugging face demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/tymasf/fungi-classification), [280-species page](https://tianyimasf.github.io/pages/work/1.html), [hugging face demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/tymasf/fungi-classification-280-species), [Real Disaster Tweets Classifcation](https://tianyimasf.github.io/pages/work/4.html), [Long Range Tabular Weather Data Forcasting](https://tianyimasf.github.io/pages/work/9.html)

🕸️ ML Algorithms from scratch: [MLP](https://github.com/tianyimasf/mlp), [Hidden Markov Chain](https://github.com/tianyimasf/sequence-hmm)

🎵 Audio processing: [Imagine](https://github.com/tianyimasf/imagine), an audio web app that converts audio files to matrices of frequencies in time bins(spectrogram) using Fast fourier transform.
